# GitHub-Battle

A Web-App that lists 30 of the most popular repositories of a language (overall also). It also lets you battle between any two GitHub users.

## How to use?

Open [Github Battle](https://github-battlereact.netlify.com/) in any browser of your choice. After the landing page pops on the screen, under the "Popular" category, you can see different header sections for most commonly used programming languages like for Javascript, Python, Java, Ruby etc. The default option among them will be set to all, but you can hover over any of them and choose one, which will redirect you to the default github repository page of the selected one. Moreover, the more exciting part of [Github-Battle](https://github-battlereact.netlify.com/) is the [Battle](https://github-battlereact.netlify.com/battle) section which can be located just beside the "Popular" category on the top left corner of the screen. User(s) can enter their Github usernames of any choice under the player section and then click on submit. Upon submit, the two entered names will automatically be assigned to their default github avatars and then battle starts (for invalid github username, invalid avatars will be assigned). Fraction of seconds later, the winner name is displayed on the screen along with name, score, address, address, followers, following as well as the total number of repositories in their accounts.
